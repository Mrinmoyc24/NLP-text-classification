# üìù NLP Text Classification with Python  

**üéØ SMS Spam Detection & Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**  

---

## üìå Description  

This repository demonstrates practical applications of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for text classification using Python. It focuses on two real-world problems:  

1. **SMS Spam Detection** ‚Äì identifying whether a message is *spam* or *ham* using the **SMSSpamCollection dataset**.  
2. **Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis** ‚Äì classifying reviews as *positive* or *negative* using the **Yelp reviews dataset**.  

The project covers the **end-to-end NLP workflow**:  

- **Preprocessing** ‚Äì cleaning text, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.  
- **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectorization.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì word frequencies, rating distributions, spam vs ham ratios.  
- **Model Training** ‚Äì Naive Bayes classifiers (MultinomialNB).  
- **Evaluation** ‚Äì accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  

**Results**:  
- SMS Spam Classifier ‚Üí >95% accuracy in detecting spam.  
- Yelp Review Classifier ‚Üí strong performance in predicting review polarity.  

This repository highlights how simple machine learning techniques can turn raw text into actionable insights and provides a baseline for more advanced NLP models.
